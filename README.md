Intro

On most projects in Nordeus there are 3 developer roles working on it: Backend, Client, and QA (Quality Assurance). Imagine you are a part of a small team of selected people in Nordeus. As the only developer there you are going to be responsible for all parts of the project that are usually done by all of these dev roles.

About the challenge

A small game project was designed and the team needs you to use your skills to turn that design into reality.

Game description

Users are shown a grid map of 30×30 cells with each cell having a height value assigned to it. A cell can either be water💧(height = 0) or land🪨(height > 0). Connected land cells represent an island🏝️. The goal of the game is to find which island has the greatest average height. Users can make their guess by clicking on any island and they have 3 attempts to guess the correct island. After 3 wrong guesses or after a successful guess the game finishes and they can choose to restart.

It’s up to you to decide the appropriate representation of the cells to make it easier/intuitive for the user to visually distinguish different heights.
